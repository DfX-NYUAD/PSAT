##  This file is for system specific configurations. For instance, on
##  some systems the path to zlib needs to be added. Example:
##
CFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include
LFLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib
CFLAGS 	+= -I/home/my29/Project_Wise/HOST_compile_1/zlib/lib128/zlib-1.2.8/
LFLAGS	+= -L/home/my29/Project_Wise/HOST_compile_1/zlib/lib128/zlib-1.2.8/
